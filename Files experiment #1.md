# QEA Files experiment #1: GitHub
## Usage

Essentially three kinds of users will interact with this system.

* Students looking to download and work on the problems
* Contributers (mainly students) looking to provide useful suggestions for changes to clarify the problems, provide useful information to help avoid frustration, and generally improve the quality of the problem set
* Instructors and NINJAs who review the proposed changes, and accept, comment on, or decline them

For regular use, students can simply view/download the file as normal, just using a [slightly different link](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/QEA-2016-experiment1/QEA-spring-2016/raw/master/Module%201/Shapes%202/QEA_ShapesII.pdf). It is *highly* recommended that you redownload/refresh this link periodically to have the most up-to-date version.

To contribte, a GitHub account is needed, but with that caveat, a simple link again is sufficient. An example is [this](https://github.com/QEA-2016-experiment1/QEA-spring-2016/edit/master/Module%201/Shapes%202/QEA_ShapesII.tex).

Approving the suggestions also requires an account, and an invitation. If you are an instructor or NINJA, email me. If it is easier, you can also email ( eric.miller@students.olin.edu ) the IDs of any pull requests you want approved and I can take care of it. Your link is [here](https://github.com/QEA-2016-experiment1/QEA-spring-2016/pulls). You should bookmark that link for easy access.


## Design

This is iteration #1 of the QEA file sharing experiment. While it would be great for everything to work fabulously and revolutionize the future of education, those kind of results aren't expected until _at_ _least_ iteration 5.

This iteration of the experiment addresses the following goals:
* Ability for students to quickly/easily view/download up-to-date PDF document
* Ability for students to propose changes to the document that can then be incorporated smoothly
* Ability for teaching team to easily review changes to the .tex files before making them official

This is NOT optimimized for...
* Students to leave quick comments on tips and tricks to help with the problem set
* Instant automatic generation of .pdf files from .tex (this is handled manually on an hourly basis)
* Containing other .tex code, like the in-class activities

In trying to be a minimal test, this experiment avoids...
* Disturbing the current teacher editing workflow
* Changing the way students work on, save, and turn in solutions

Let's see how this goes.
