# Spring 2016 QEA course documents

Because QEA is an experiment this year, there is lots of room for students to help improve the course materials. This git repository is the first experiment in allowing that to happen. 

Students can propose edits by clicking a .tex file, clicking the edit button (pencil), then finding and making changes before submitting at the bottom of the page. Instructors and NINJAs can review these proposals on the "Pull requests" tab at the top of the screen.

To start with, the .tex files will be recompiled to .pdf about once per hour. Eventually, this process can be automated.
